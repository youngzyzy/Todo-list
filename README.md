This todo list project uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS, but it mainly was used for practicing my JS. This simple application has a lot of simple funcitonality. This app error checks to make sure input is valid to avoid repetative/empty inputs. You are able to mark an item complete by clicking the circle or the text. It uses local storage to save the task input and task completion.
